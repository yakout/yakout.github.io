I am a Computer And Systems Engineering Graduate from Alexandria University, interested in Big Data, Machine learning, Deep learning, Distributed Systems, Databases, Backend, Math, and all other things data!

I document what I learn in my daily life, and also write about problems that I face and how I solved them, as I believe that this is the best way to guarantee an effective learning and a good, organized reference to look back in the future.

Note: I am available for weddings, and other events that are likely to include food, chocolate and cupcakes.
