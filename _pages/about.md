I am a Computer And Systems Engineering Graduate from Alexandria University, I used to have interests in Big Data, Machine learning, and Deep learning. But now I am focused more in Distributed Systems, Cloud Systems, Databases, Scalabilty, Performance Optimization, Operating Systems, and all other things Backend!

<!-- I document what I learn in my daily life, and also write about problems that I face and how I solved them, as I believe that this is the best way to guarantee an effective learning and a good, organized reference to look back in the future. -->

**Note:** I am available for weddings, and other events that are likely to include food, chocolate and cupcakes.
