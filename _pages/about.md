I am a third year Computer And Systems Engineering student at Alexandria University, interested in Big Data, Machine learning, Deep learning, Distributed Systems, Parallel programming and all other things data!

I am here to document everything I learn in my daily life, and also write about problems that I face and how I solved them, as I believe that this is the best way to guarantee an effective learning and a good, organized reference to look back in the future.
