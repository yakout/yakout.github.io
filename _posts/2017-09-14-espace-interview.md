I have applied to a Software Engineer Intern position from [eSpace site](https://www.espace.com.eg/company/jobs)

Weeks later I have received a phone call from the interviewer that asked me If I am free to make a quick interview on the go.
The questions he asked:
- The difference between queue and dequeue.
- The difference between stack and queue.
- How can you report and find bugs in an mobile application.
- How to make sure that every opened parenthesis ‘(‘ is closed e.g ```(1 + 3 + (1 * 4) - 1 * (1 - 5))```
- Are you currently active on `Github`?
- What is the difference between `SQL` and `NoSQL`.

That’s it, hope I didn’t miss anything, the call lasted about 15 mins.

Weeks later I got a phone call from the HR invited me to take the onsite test at the company headquarter in **Loran, Alexandria**.
unfortunately that was during my final exams period but luckily the test time was after my exam, so I finished the exam and went to the company.

The test was on paper and the questions were shuffled:
First you choose 3 topics form about 10 topics in computer science like:

- Web development
- game development 
- mobile development
- security
- databases
- linux administration
- Find the bug
- data structures and algorithms and others

My questions were:

* Algorithms and Data structures 
    1. What are Dead locks and how to prevent it.
    2. How to detect Loops in linked list.

<!-- 3. Players matching.
4. Twitter
5. What happens when you search google.com
6. Max x. -->

* Find the bug: 
	1.  

	```
	Thead 1:
	Synchronized (A) {
		Synchronized (B){}
	}

	Thread 2: 
	Synchronized (B) {
	    Synchronized (C) {} 
	} 

	Thread 3: 
	Synchronized (C) {
	    Synchronized (D) {} 
	}
	```

Other two questions that involved Javascript and C++ code that I can’t remember in details.

* Mobile 
1. Do you prefer native apps or hybrid apps, why?
2. Favorite mobile app and how it's implemented.
3. What is Deep linking and how it's working.

## Pros And Cons:
Pros:
- Interview process was relatively easy.

Cons: 
- They don’t use email for communication when there is a test they call you on the phone.
- they don’t send rejection emails (When I asked the HR why? she told me that the number of application is big so can’t send to all of them! really!! how google manage over 10000+ applications then?)
