Objectives:
Master the process of hyperparameter tuning



## Hyperparamter tuning

## Batch normalization

## Multi-class classificatin 

## Intro to Deeplearning frameworks
placeholder is a variable whose values you assign later.
you use it to get your data into the cost function 

feed different mini batches

with command is better at cleaning up in case of errors and exceptions while executing 

what does it do?

tf knows how to compute the derivates and minimize the cost functin J

the cost = equaitn allows tf to constructs a computation graph.

draw the graph look screen shot


tf has built-in the neccessary backward functions, so no need to explicity implement backpropagation.
