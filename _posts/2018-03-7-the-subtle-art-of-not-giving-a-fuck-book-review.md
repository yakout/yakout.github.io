## Review
Once I finish reading the book I will write the full review here.
Meanwhile check the quotes section.

## Quotes
Here is some of my favourite quotes so far.

> "The point isn't to get away from the shit. The point is to find the shit you enjoy dealing with."

> "What you consider 'friendship' is really just your constant attempts to impress people."

> "We suffer for the simple reason that suffering is biologically useful. It is natures's prefered agent for inspiring change."

> "We are wired to become dissatisfied with whatever we have and satisfied by only what we do not have. This constant dissatisfaction has kept our species fighting and striving, building and conquering. So no, our pain and misery aren't a bug of human evolution; they're a feature."
