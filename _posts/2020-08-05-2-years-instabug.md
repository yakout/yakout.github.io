Today marked as exactly two years at Instabug.

I started as an Intern in Summer 2018 for two months, and managed to work as part-time while I was on my forth year in college.

It's one of my best career moves so far, joinig the squad that is full of diverse, challenges and super talented people makes you grow really fast.

2 years full of fun, challenges, and friendly people around you, I am very thankful for every moment I spent here.
